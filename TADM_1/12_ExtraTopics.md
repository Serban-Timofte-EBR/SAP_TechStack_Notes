# SAP Fiori Overview

SAP Fiori is a user experience (UX) design system developed by SAP to offer a responsive and modern interface for SAP applications. It follows the principles of simplicity, efficiency, and consistency.

## Key Components of SAP Fiori

### 1. **Tiles**
- **Definition**: Tiles are visual representations (icons or widgets) that provide access to specific Fiori applications on the Fiori Launchpad.
- **Types of Tiles**:
  - **Static Tile**: Displays static content like a label or a count.
  - **Dynamic Tile**: Shows real-time data such as pending tasks or updates.
- **Usage**: Tiles are organized on the Fiori Launchpad for easy access to applications.

### 2. **Catalogs**
- **Definition**: A catalog is a collection of tiles that are organized by role or functionality. Catalogs are used to assign tiles to users.
- **Types of Catalogs**:
  - **Standard Catalog**: Contains various tiles, usually for administrative purposes.
  - **Role-Based Catalogs**: Tailored for specific user roles, e.g., "Sales Manager," containing only relevant apps.
- **Usage**: Catalogs organize tiles and allow administrators to assign them to specific roles or users.

### 3. **Groups**
- **Definition**: Groups are collections of tiles presented together on the Fiori Launchpad. A group can be either predefined or personalized.
- **Usage**: Groups enable users to quickly access a collection of related tiles. They are part of the personalized Fiori Launchpad experience.

### 4. **Spaces**
- **Definition**: Spaces define the layout and structure of the Fiori Launchpad. They help organize and present tiles and groups in a logical, user-specific way.
- **Usage**: Spaces are used to create different "views" for different user roles, ensuring users see relevant content based on their role. For example, a "Manager Space" might have different tiles and groups compared to a "Clerk Space."

### 5. **Roles**
- **Definition**: Roles define the permissions a user has in accessing specific Fiori applications and their associated tiles.
- **Usage**: Roles determine which catalogs, tiles, and groups a user can access. For instance, the "Sales Manager" role might have access to sales-related tiles and catalogs.

## How They Work Together

1. **Roles** define the access levels for users.
2. **Catalogs** organize tiles and assign them to roles.
3. **Groups** provide logical grouping of tiles for better user organization on the Launchpad.
4. **Spaces** allow for customized layouts for different roles, organizing catalogs and groups on the Fiori Launchpad.

## Example: "Sales Manager" Role

- **Role**: Sales Manager
- **Catalog**: Sales Manager Catalog (contains tiles like "Create Sales Order," "View Sales Analytics")
- **Group**: Sales Overview (groups together "Create Sales Order" and "View Sales Analytics")
- **Space**: Sales Manager Space (includes the "Sales Overview" and "Customer Information" groups)

## Benefits of Segregation

- **Customization**: Spaces and groups allow for a personalized, role-based interface.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Tiles and catalogs are shown based on the userâ€™s role.
- **Centralized Management**: Administrators can manage the experience by controlling catalogs, spaces, and groups.

## Summary

- **Tiles**: Individual applications or actions displayed on the Fiori Launchpad.
- **Catalogs**: Groups of tiles assigned to specific roles or functionalities.
- **Groups**: Logical collections of tiles shown together for users.
- **Spaces**: The overall layout and structure of the Fiori Launchpad, defining how tiles and groups are displayed for different users.
